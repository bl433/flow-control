Suggested components:
 - resistors
 - MOSFET transistors or relays

Main Switch:
 - single-pole, single-throw
 - final decision: entire solenoid valve is off if this is off

Potentiometer Knob:
 - turnable, variable resistor
 - solenoid valve increases flow output as knob turns to reduce resistance (to increase allowed voltage to solenoid valve)
 - opposite if knob turns to increase resistance (to decrease allowed voltage to solenoid valve)

Solenoid Valve:
 - handles liquid transfer based on Main Switch and Potentiometer Knob
 - 3/4in diameter
 - 12V, 2A input
 ~ 30 min active time until it begins to overheat
