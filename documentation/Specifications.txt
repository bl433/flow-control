Suggested components:
 - resistors
 - MOSFET transistors or relays
 - indicator LEDs
 - 5V voltage regulators

Main Switch:
 - single-pole, single-throw
 - final decision: entire solenoid valve is off if this is off

Potentiometer Knob:
 - turnable, variable resistor
 - delays the solenoid valve for a variable amount of hours depending how far the potentiometer turns
 - solenoid valve is allowed a specific duty cycle to conserve water
 - turning the knob at maximum should allow the solenoid to open every 24 hours,
 - while turning the knob at minimum should allow the solenoid to open every 1 hours.
 - another knob can be used to decide how LONG the solenoid valve opens.

Solenoid Valve:
 - handles liquid transfer based on Main Switch ~~and Potentiometer Knob~~
 - 3/4in diameter
 - 12V, 2A input
 ~ 30 min active time until it begins to overheat
