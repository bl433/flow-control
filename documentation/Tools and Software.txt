We didn't create things out of thin air. We'll be listing what's been made and how.

[Softwares]
- Github, to organize this entire directory and have it presentable in a professional manner.
- Github Desktop, to organize the directory from the computer standpoint.
- Microsoft Word (or Google Docs), to create reports and documents for professional exposure.
- Arduino (we'll need to minimize it.)
 - https://www.instructables.com/Bare-Minimum-Arduino-on-Breadboard/

[Hardwares]
- Solenoid liquid valves, to control water or fertilizer flowing through the pipe.
 [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018WRJYOU/]
- 12V power supply or renewable source (solar panel)
 - step up converter
- and? 4x 18650 batteries in series
 - 4S BMS
- 5V regulator or 5V buck converter
- LEDs
- i think we'll need to bring in the arduino for this.
- at LEAST just bring in the arduino chip and minimize it.
- For each lane:
 - 1x solenoid liquid valve
 - 2x potentiometer knobs
 - 1x single-pole-single-throw switch
 - 1x green LED (active), 1x red LED (blinking if waiting, solid red if disabled)
  - neither LEDs will be on until a solenoid is connected to it.

[Components]
- MOSFET transistors, to enable or disable the solenoid valves.
- Resistors, to regulate voltage.
- Switches, to decide if the valve would be on or off.
- Potentiometers, to adjust the open duration and delay of the solenoid.
